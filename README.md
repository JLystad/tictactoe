# tictactoe
Board game of tic tac toe. Open in local host
Improvments id like to make is one adding a line that crosses out the winners choices like in a traditional way, I can just add a simple line that grows out from eithe corner since its a square. And another one is the ability to not reset a choice a player made, once he or she chooses a swaure they are stuck wwith that decision. Potentioally making it more flashy as well.
